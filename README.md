# deepfake-image-onnx
This repo demonstrates an example of how to run ONNX models. This example is aimed to help guide students in the first assignment in the Spring offering of 596E. Further improves can be made, especially when it comes to removing unnecessary dependencies (but this isn't a requirement in the first assignment).
